Black Lives Matter!

This project is intended to help make sense of output from Portland FOIA requests for text messages.  It formats it into a format that is vaguely like a cell phone text message as an interactive HTML page.

It includes a built-in contact manager, so you can add your own contacts as numbers are identified, as well as tooltips with additional information.  There are a number of formatting rules to help readability.

An example looks like this:
